### COMMIT 15 — 2026-02-16T00:30:00Z
**Milestone:** Full Function URL migration — All 36 EU Lambdas now have AuthType=NONE Function URLs (16 switched from AWS_IAM, 10 newly created, 10 already NONE). All endpoints in region-config.ts rewired to Function URLs (no more 30s API Gateway timeout). Fixed EU_DEEP_RESEARCH_TABLE missing from eu_config.py. Removed EU_ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION from 2 more helpers. All 29 Lambdas redeployed. Build #51 SUCCEED (b4ff16b). Backend 1403b21 pushed.
**State:** DONE
**Files Changed:**
- MODIFIED: region-config.ts — All 35 EU endpoints use Function URLs directly
- MODIFIED: eu_config.py — Added EU_DEEP_RESEARCH_TABLE
- MODIFIED: EUOnboardUser/helpers.py — Removed EU_ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION
- MODIFIED: EUProcessDeepDocument/helpers.py — Removed EU_ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION
- REPACKAGED: eu_upload_deep_document with PyJWT
- IAM: 16 switched + 10 created Function URLs
- DEPLOYED: 29 Lambdas
- COMMITTED: b4ff16b (frontend), 1403b21 (backend)
**Key Decisions:**
- Full Function URL migration eliminates API Gateway 30s timeout
- Upload Lambda needs pip dependencies in ZIP
- EU_DEEP_RESEARCH_TABLE was never in eu_config.py
**Next:**
- [ ] User verifies all features on live site
- [ ] Full Pallas E2E regression
- [ ] Production launch
**Blockers:** None
