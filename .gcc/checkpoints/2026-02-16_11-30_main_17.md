### COMMIT 17 — 2026-02-16T11:30:00Z
**Milestone:** Sprint verification complete — All 4 plan sprints confirmed done (Subscription Lambda deployed + Enterprise tier active, Document panel light theme, Session ID filtering + enhanced system prompt, all implemented in prior sessions). Cleaned up 8 orphan Amplify env vars (7 branch-level, 1 app-level). Updated .env.eu.example to reflect only actually-used vars (removed 19 stale NEXT_PUBLIC_EU_*_URL entries). System health verified: 36/36 Lambdas Active, subscription returns Enterprise tier for support@quantamixsolutions.com, all Function URLs match region-config.ts. Frontend facc5f0 pushed.
**State:** DONE
**Files Changed:**
- MODIFIED: .env.eu.example — Removed 19 orphan env vars, added 4 actually-used server-side vars (DYNAMO_*, AUTH_COOKIE_KEY, CANVAS_MOCK_LLM)
- REMOVED: 8 Amplify env vars — CHAT_ATHENA_EU_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_ATHENA_EU_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CANVAS, NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CANVAS_3D, NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CANVAS_CHAINING, NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CANVAS_COLLAB, NEXT_PUBLIC_EU_UPLOAD_URL (branch), NEXT_PUBLIC_EU_API_GATEWAY_URL (app)
- COMMITTED: facc5f0 (frontend — .env.eu.example cleanup)
**Key Decisions:**
- All 19 NEXT_PUBLIC_EU_*_URL env vars in .env.eu.example were orphans — code uses hardcoded Lambda Function URLs in region-config.ts, not env vars
- Remaining Amplify vars: 8 branch-level (all used), 11 app-level (all used)
- Friction emit route still needs AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET or refactor to use DYNAMO_* keys — deferred to user decision
**Next:**
- [ ] Full Pallas E2E regression (wait for Build #52 SUCCEED + 5 min propagation)
- [ ] Fix friction emit AWS creds (or refactor)
- [ ] Production launch preparation
**Blockers:** None
