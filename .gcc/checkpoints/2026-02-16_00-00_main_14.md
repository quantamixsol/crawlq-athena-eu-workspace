### COMMIT 14 — 2026-02-16T00:00:00Z
**Milestone:** Major fixes — Upload 503 resolved (removed eu_test_semantic, async graph builder + insights via InvocationType=Event), Canvas LLM rewired to Bedrock Claude Opus 4.6 directly (bypasses chat Lambda), Lambda Function URL 403 root cause found and fixed (missing `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission on 8 functions — NOT an SCP), eu_config defaults corrected (eu_create_project_proxy → eu_create_project). Bedrock IAM permissions added to all Amplify SSR roles. Frontend Build #50 RUNNING (cb0844f). Backend 291d4ee pushed. Lambdas deployed: eu_upload_deep_document (45KB), eu_generate_deep_insights (50KB).
**State:** WORKING
**Files Changed:**
- MODIFIED: shared/eu_config.py — Fixed EU_CREATE_PROJECT_FUNCTION default; removed EU_ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION
- MODIFIED: EUUploadDeepDocument/helpers.py — Removed invoke_train_athena; async graph builder + insights
- MODIFIED: execute-llm/route.ts — Direct Bedrock InvokeModel (Claude Opus 4.6)
- MODIFIED: LLMNode.tsx — Updated model options
- MODIFIED: package.json — Moved @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime to dependencies
- IAM: Bedrock permissions on 4 Amplify roles + InvokeFunction on 8 Lambda functions
- DEPLOYED: eu_upload_deep_document (45KB), eu_generate_deep_insights (50KB)
- COMMITTED: cb0844f (frontend), 291d4ee (backend)
**Key Decisions:**
- Upload async processing to avoid API Gateway 30s timeout
- KG+RAG only, no semantic search training
- Canvas LLM direct Bedrock, not through chat Lambda
- Function URL 403 was missing InvokeFunction permission, not SCP
**Next:**
- [ ] Verify Build #50 SUCCEED
- [ ] User verifies upload + Canvas LLM
- [ ] Full Pallas E2E regression
- [ ] Production launch
**Blockers:** Amplify SSR Bedrock permissions depend on correct compute role
