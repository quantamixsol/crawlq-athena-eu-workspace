### COMMIT 8 — 2026-02-16T01:00:00Z
**Milestone:** UX polish + deployment sprint — TRACE card expanded by default (all 5 pillars + 6 metrics visible immediately), action bar decluttered (icon-only buttons, removed duplicate metadata, softened AI badge), Canvas env vars added to main Amplify app (10 vars including CHAT_ATHENA_EU_URL), Build #39 SUCCEED (c81d0ae). Full Pallas regression: 185 PASS / 0 FAIL pre-deploy, 62 PASS / 0 FAIL post-deploy verification.
**State:** DONE
**Branch:** main

**Changes:**
1. ChatTraceCard.tsx: `useState(false)` → `useState(true)` — TRACE card shows expanded by default
2. ChatMessageBubble.tsx: Action bar converted to icon-only buttons with tooltips, removed duplicate model/tokens/time metadata (already in TRACE card), AI-Generated badge softened to subtle zinc tones with Art. 50 reference
3. Amplify env vars: Added 10 Canvas-related env vars to main app (d45bl3mgpjnhy) — CHAT_ATHENA_EU_URL, CANVAS_MOCK_LLM, NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CANVAS, etc.
