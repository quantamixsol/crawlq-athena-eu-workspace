### COMMIT 16 — 2026-02-16T10:00:00Z
**Milestone:** Full E2E System Inventory — 36 Lambda functions audited (handlers, Function URLs, env vars, inter-invocation map), 30 frontend endpoints mapped (request/response payloads, auth patterns, cache config), 25 API Gateway routes documented (5 JWT, 20 NONE, 1 broken POST /chat). Amplify env vars cross-referenced (8 orphans found, 2 missing critical: friction emit AWS creds). Fixed remaining stale code: EUOnboardUser/helpers.py still had invoke_train_athena function body + call in onboard_user, EUProcessDeepDocument/helpers.py still had ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION in process_document tasks dict, conftest.py had eu_create_project_proxy + ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION. Both Lambdas redeployed. Created GSM manifest, summary, ADR-042. Added Amplify build wait rule to CLAUDE.md. Backend 1a50d3d pushed.
**State:** DONE
**Files Changed:**
- MODIFIED: EUOnboardUser/helpers.py — Removed invoke_train_athena function + call in onboard_user
- MODIFIED: EUProcessDeepDocument/helpers.py — Removed rag_training task referencing undefined ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION
- MODIFIED: tests/conftest.py — Fixed CREATE_PROJECT_FUNCTION, removed ATHENA_TRAINING_FUNCTION
- MODIFIED: .claude/CLAUDE.md — Amplify build wait rule strengthened
- CREATED: .gsm/external/2026-02-16_EU-System-E2E-Inventory.md — Living E2E system manifest
- CREATED: .gsm/summaries/EU-System-E2E-Inventory.summary.md
- CREATED: .gsm/decisions/ADR-042-eu-system-e2e-inventory.md
- DEPLOYED: eu_onboard_user, eu_process_deep_document — both Successful
- COMMITTED: 1a50d3d (backend)
**Key Decisions:**
- Previous session only removed imports but left function bodies — runtime crash risk. Fixed completely.
- 8 orphan Amplify env vars, 2 missing critical vars identified
- API Gateway POST /chat broken integration — not impacting users (Function URL in use)
**Next:**
- [ ] User verifies all features on live site
- [ ] Clean up orphan Amplify env vars
- [ ] Full Pallas E2E regression
- [ ] Production launch
**Blockers:** None
