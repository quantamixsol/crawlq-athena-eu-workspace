### COMMIT 13 — 2026-02-15T23:15:00Z
**Milestone:** Upload + Canvas + shared module fixes. Fixed binary payload crash in `normalize_event()` (UnicodeDecodeError on PDF uploads via API Gateway). Fixed Canvas LLM node "CHAT_ATHENA_EU_URL not configured" by adding hardcoded API Gateway fallback. Deployed updated `shared/lambda_utils.py` to all 12 critical Lambdas. Upload verified working (200 OK, document ID returned, S3 upload succeeded). Frontend Build #49 SUCCEED (f4b90a6). Backend 0f9454d pushed.
**State:** DONE
**Files Changed:**
- MODIFIED: shared/lambda_utils.py — Handle binary payloads in normalize_event
- MODIFIED: execute-llm/route.ts — Add API Gateway fallback URL
- DEPLOYED: 12 Lambdas with updated shared module
- COMMITTED: f4b90a6 (frontend), 0f9454d (backend)
- BUILD: #49 SUCCEED
**Key Decisions:**
- Binary payloads: catch UnicodeDecodeError, preserve base64 body
- Always preserve body key in normalized event
- Canvas LLM: hardcoded fallback matches region-config.ts
**Next:**
- [ ] User verifies upload, Canvas, deep research on live site
- [ ] Full Pallas E2E regression
- [ ] Production launch
**Blockers:** None
