### Summary
Conducted PhD-level research on interactive canvas capabilities for TRACE platform. Evaluated 8 canvas libraries and 5 visualization libraries across performance, React integration, bundle size, features, licensing. Designed hybrid multi-mode architecture (React Flow + Tldraw + Reagraph 3D) that no competitor offers. Created 2 comprehensive ADRs documenting architectural decisions. Defined unique value propositions for PhD researchers (citation networks), B2B analysts (competitive intelligence), and compliance officers (regulatory mapping). Delivered complete feature specification with user personas, wireframes, technical architecture, OKRs, pricing strategy ($29/mo Pro, $99/mo Enterprise). Built 12-week implementation roadmap with 4 phases, resource allocation (2 frontend engineers + 1 backend + 1 designer = 33 person-weeks), budget estimate ($23,600 Year 1), and risk register. Research phase COMPLETE, ready for stakeholder approval and Phase 0 implementation (Week 1 technical spikes).
