Time: 3.8s | Model: eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1
Confidence: RED (0.45)
Context retained: YES

Based on my DPIA template above, the **top 3 critical sections** are:

- **System Description & Processing Overview** — defines what data is collected, how it flows, and where it's processed (Frankfurt, EU)

- **Necessity, Proportionality & Lawful Basis** — establishes legal justification under Article 6 and Article 22 compliance for automated decision-making

- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** — identifies threats to data subjects' rights and documents safeguards to address them
