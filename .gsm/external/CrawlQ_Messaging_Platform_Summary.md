# CrawlQ.AI — Copy & Messaging Platform Summary
### Including Typography, Design System & UI/UX Recommendations

---

## 1. Brand Identity

**Company:** CrawlQ.AI
**Product:** FrictionMelt — AI Friction Intelligence Platform
**Tagline (Recommended):** "AI You Can Defend"
**Product Tagline:** "Melt the Friction. Accelerate AI."

**Logo:** CrawlQ.AI diagonal bars mark — dark geometric letterforms. Original asset has a black background; for web use, the background is removed to transparent PNG. The logo must remain clearly visible on both light (white/off-white) and dark (navy) backgrounds.

**Alternate Tagline Options (from messaging platform):**

| Tagline | Best Use |
|---|---|
| AI You Can Defend | Master tagline — all contexts |
| Provable Market Intelligence | Enterprise sales materials |
| AI That Shows Its Work | Product pages, demos |
| Audit-Ready AI Marketing | Compliance-focused audiences |
| Move Fast, Stay Safe | Campaign / social media hook |
| AI Insights That Survive Scrutiny | Thought leadership, whitepapers |
| We Eliminate Your AI Risk | Direct response, landing pages |

## 2. Voice & Tone

### Who We Sound Like
A trusted advisor who has been in your shoes. Someone who understands both the pressure and the constraints. A partner who respects your intelligence. An expert who explains things clearly — not too technically.

### Who We Don't Sound Like
A salesperson making exaggerated claims. A tech vendor listing features. An academic explaining AI theory. A consultant talking down to clients.

### Core Voice Characteristics

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Confident** | We know what we're doing — but never arrogant |
| **Empathetic** | We understand the real pressures CMOs and CIOs face |
| **Conversational** | First-person, direct, human language |
| **Clear** | Plain language, no jargon, concrete outcomes |
| **Bold** | We make strong claims — backed by evidence |
| **Practical** | We talk about what works, not what's theoretically possible |

### Pronoun Rules
Always use personal pronouns to maintain warmth and directness:

| Do This | Not This |
|---|---|
| "We built this for you" | "CrawlQ.AI was built for" |
| "You move faster because Legal says yes" | "The platform enables organizations to accelerate" |
| "Every answer shows where it came from" | "The platform features immutable provenance tracking" |
| "We built compliance into how the system works" | "Leverage our proprietary TRACE Protocol" |

**Key rule:** Avoid overusing "CrawlQ.AI" or "the platform" — it makes the company sound like a cold, disconnected tech vendor.

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Website & Sales | Bold, confident — not loud or abrasive | "The only AI platform where risk goes down as speed goes up." |
| Customer Communications | Supportive, partnership-oriented | "We're in this together." |
| Thought Leadership | Authoritative but accessible | Layman's terms, no jargon, clearly understood by many |
| Product Education | Clear and practical | Plain language, benefits and concrete outcomes |

### Language Patterns

**Use these patterns:**
- "You're stuck between..." (acknowledges their reality)
- "We built this because..." (personal, purposeful)
- "Here's what that means for you..." (benefit-focused)
- "You shouldn't have to choose between..." (empathetic)
- "We've seen this challenge before..." (experienced)

**Never use these patterns:**
- "CrawlQ.AI's patented technology..." (corporate, impersonal)
- "Leverage our innovative solution..." (buzzword-heavy)
- "Best-in-class enterprise platform..." (generic claims)
- "The organization provides..." (distant, formal)
- "Revolutionary breakthrough..." (hyperbolic)

### Campaign-Ready Message Lines

## 4. Typography System

### Font Family

**Primary:** Plus Jakarta Sans
**Fallback stack:** `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`
**Source:** Google Fonts — `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800`

**Why Plus Jakarta Sans:** Modern geometric sans-serif that reads as premium and trustworthy without being cold. Excellent legibility at small sizes. Strong bold weights for confident headlines. Pairs well with enterprise B2B positioning — neither too playful nor too stiff.

### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero headline | `clamp(1.95rem, 4.2vw, 2.75rem)` | 800 | 1.15 | -0.03em | Navy #0E1935 |
| Section headline (h2) | `clamp(1.5rem, 2.8vw, 2rem)` | 700 | 1.25 | -0.02em | Navy #0E1935 |
| Card title (h3) | `0.95rem` (15.2px) | 700 | 1.35 | normal | Navy #0E1935 |
| Body text | `1rem` (16px) | 400 | 1.72 | normal | Dark Gray #374151 |
| Subheadline | `1rem` (16px) | 400 | 1.72 | normal | Mid Gray #4B5563 |
| Caption / metadata | `0.875rem` (14px) min | 500 | 1.45 | normal | Gray #6B7280 |
| Pill / badge label | `0.7rem` (11.2px) | 700 | 1.0 | 0.09em uppercase | Blue #5485FE |
| Button text | `0.92rem` (14.7px) | 600 | 1.0 | normal | White #FFFFFF |
| Footer text | `0.78rem` (12.5px) | 400 | 1.45 | normal | Gray #6B7280 |

### Typography Rules

1. **Absolute minimum for readable text:** 14px (0.875rem) — only for captions and metadata
2. **Body text never below:** 16px (1rem) on any device
3. **Headlines always use clamp():** Never fixed px sizes that break on mobile
4. **Blue accent text (#5485FE):** Only for pills, badges, links, and CTAs — never for body paragraphs
5. **Light blue (#A8C4FF):** Decorative only — never for readable text on light backgrounds
6. **Font weights loaded:** 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 (load only what you use)
7. **Font display:** Always `font-display: swap` to prevent invisible text during load

## 9. CrawlQ × FrictionMelt Brand Relationship

### How the Brands Connect

**CrawlQ.AI** is the parent company and trusted brand name. **FrictionMelt** is the product/methodology — the AI Friction Intelligence Platform.

| Element | CrawlQ.AI | FrictionMelt |
|---|---|---|
| Role | Company brand | Product / methodology brand |
| Logo | Diagonal bars mark + "CrawlQ.AI" wordmark | "FrictionMelt" wordmark |
| Tagline | "AI You Can Defend" | "Melt the Friction. Accelerate AI." |
| Voice | Trusted advisor, empathetic, compliance-first | Same voice — slightly more technical when discussing methodology |
| Primary audience | CMOs, compliance leaders | CIOs, CDOs, engineering leads |
| Design system | Shared — same colors, fonts, components | Shared |

### Shared Design DNA
Both brands use the identical design system documented above. The visual language should be indistinguishable — a user moving between crawlq.ai and frictionmelt.com should feel they are in the same ecosystem. The only differences are the logo and page-specific content.

### Logo Placement Rules
- **CrawlQ.AI logo:** Nav bar (top-left), footer, "Powered by CrawlQ.AI" on FrictionMelt pages
- **FrictionMelt wordmark:** Hero section of frictionmelt.com, product-specific materials
- **Co-branded:** "FrictionMelt by CrawlQ.AI" for external materials, LinkedIn, press

### Voice Consistency Across Both Brands
The CrawlQ messaging platform voice applies to ALL communications under both brands. There is no separate "FrictionMelt voice." FrictionMelt content simply focuses on the methodology and technical outcomes while maintaining the same empathetic, first-person, outcome-driven tone.

**FrictionMelt-specific message examples (in CrawlQ voice):**
- "We find the friction in your AI workflows — the places where data breaks, decisions go opaque, and governance gaps hide. Then we melt it."
- "Most AI projects don't fail because of bad technology. They fail because of friction."
- "You shouldn't have to choose between speed and safety. We give your team both."

## 10. Quick-Reference: Do's and Don'ts

### Content Do's
✅ Use "We," "You," "Your team," "Our"
✅ Lead with the problem, not the product
✅ Show concrete outcomes and numbers
✅ Acknowledge real pressures leaders face
✅ Keep sentences short and scannable
✅ Use benefit-first language ("Here's what that means for you")

### Content Don'ts
❌ Overuse "CrawlQ.AI" or "the platform"
❌ Use buzzwords: leverage, innovative, revolutionary, best-in-class
❌ List features without connecting to outcomes
❌ Use B2C direct-response language
❌ Talk down to the reader
❌ Make unsubstantiated claims

### Design Do's
✅ Use Plus Jakarta Sans for everything
✅ Maintain 4.5:1 minimum contrast for all readable text
✅ Use blue (#5485FE) only for interactive elements and accents
✅ Alternate white/off-white section backgrounds
✅ Ensure all touch targets ≥ 44px on mobile
✅ Use clamp() for responsive typography

### Design Don'ts
❌ Use light blue (#A8C4FF) for readable text on light backgrounds
❌ Use text lighter than #6B7280 on white/off-white backgrounds
❌ Use fixed pixel font sizes for headlines
❌ Mix icon families (stick to one: Lucide or Feather)
❌ Use more than one primary CTA button per section
❌ Use gradients or heavy shadows — keep it clean and minimal
