## Key Points
1. Master tagline: "AI You Can Defend" — used across all contexts. Product: "Melt the Friction. Accelerate AI."
2. Voice: Trusted advisor, empathetic, confident, conversational, clear, bold, practical. Use "We/You/Your" — never "CrawlQ.AI's platform" or buzzwords.
3. Font: Plus Jakarta Sans (300-800 weights). Body 16px min, headlines via clamp(). Never below 14px for any text.
4. Colors: Navy #0E1935 (headlines/dark bg), Blue #5485FE (CTAs/accent), Off-white #F7F9FC (alt sections). Body text #374151 (7.5:1 contrast).
5. Design: Cards 14px radius, buttons 8px radius 44px min-height, clean/minimal, no gradients except brand gradient buttons.
